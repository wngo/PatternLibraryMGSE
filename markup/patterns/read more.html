            The Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) has engaged the University of Melbourne and our partner, the Australian College of Educators, to design, develop and deliver the process and impact evaluation of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (the Standards; formerly known as the National Professional Standards for Teachers), which is planned to conclude in December 2015.

                    The Standards were developed by AITSL and endorsed by the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs (MCEEDYA). The Standards provide a framework to enhance the profession of teaching by providing consistent benchmarks for teaching practice and performance, and by increasing the consistency of teacher quality across Australia.
